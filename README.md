# R-Coding-Comparison-of-Inflation-Rates
I looked at past years inflation rates to compare to recent rates and determine if inflation has gone up drastically.
I used R coding to upload and clean the dataset. 
I then performed statistical methods on the data to find outliers and common patterns.
The results of my data analysis used statistics to prove the inflation rates have not drastically increased.
